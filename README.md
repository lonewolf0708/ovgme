Presentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OvGME is a game mod manager based on the idea and concept of JSGME. It takes the GME acronym 
from JSGME which stands for Generic Mod Enabler. The main purpose of OvGME is to provide an 
easy way to import and enable mods for games, then restore the original files when disabling mods. 
OvGME works by comparing the game file tree with the given mod file tree, then identifies
what files to replace, create, and save as a backup.

OvGME implements the following key features:

- Support for multiple games through the main GUI.
- Custom Mods and Backup folder for each game.
- Game file tree snapshot and comparison based on xxHash.
- Zipped Mods files (Mod-Archives).
- Mods description (readme.txt).
- Mods versioning.
- Mods enabling profile for each game.	
- Mods network repositories.
- Mods online updating and downloading.
- Zip Mod-Archive creation tool.
- XML repository creation tool.
- Detailed embeded Help.
